## 3. Key Insights (Consolidated)

### 3.1 Sales & Demand Trends
- Total Amount generated and orders show a fluctuating (zigzag) weekly pattern rather than steady growth.
- High revenue weeks are sometimes driven by **bulk purchases**, not just high order count.
- Certain weeks generate higher revenue even with fewer orders due to higher-value or bulk orders.

### 3.2 Customer Buying Behavior
- Most customers purchase **1–3 items**, but bulk buying (6–10 and above 10 units) contributes significantly to revenue.
- Customers tend to buy mid-priced products in bulk rather than very low or very high-priced items.
- Buying patterns are similar across genders, indicating demand is product-driven rather than gender-driven.

### 3.3 Product Performance
- Core products: **T-Shirts, Jeans, Sneakers**
  - High order volume
  - High revenue contribution
  - Consistently good customer ratings
- Secondary products: **Tank Tops, Hoodies, Shorts**
  - Moderate demand
  - Strong potential for growth through bundling and promotions
- Low-performing products (e.g., Baseball Caps) show low demand, low quantity sold, and low revenue.

### 3.4 Geography & Operations
- Highest customer concentration comes from:
  - Los Angeles
  - San Diego
  - Santa Clara
  - Sacramento
  - Alameda
- Delivery performance is strong overall, with most orders delivered within 1–3 days.
- Some delays are observed for core products in high-demand regions, which may impact customer experience if not addressed.

### 3.5 Customer Satisfaction
- Customer ratings are consistently high (4 and 5) across months.
- Ratings are largely independent of gender, location, unit price, or bulk quantity.
- Certain products (e.g., Graphic Tees) show a relatively higher share of low ratings and may need quality or process review.

1. **Focus on core products (T-Shirts, Jeans, Sneakers)**  
   Prioritize inventory availability, promotions, and faster delivery for these products since they drive the majority of revenue and customer satisfaction.

   Promote bundle offers and quantity-based discounts for mid-priced products such as Tank Tops, Hoodies, and Leggings to increase average order value.

3. **Optimize product portfolio**

and inventory costs.

4. **Strengthen operations in high-demand regions**  
   Improve delivery capacity in top-performing counties to avoid delays and protect customer satisfaction.

5. **Use fast delivery as a competitive advantage**  
   Since most orders are delivered within 1–3 days, this strength can be highlighted in marketing communication.
